# IoT Reference Integration for Corstone-3xx
## Introduction
This reference integration demonstrates how to develop cloud connected applications and update them securely by integrating modular [FreeRTOS kernel](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html) and [libraries](https://www.freertos.org/libraries/categories.html) and utilizing hardware enforced security based on [Arm TrustZone (Armv8-M)](https://www.arm.com/architecture/learn-the-architecture/m-profile). This project is based on [Corstone-300](https://developer.arm.com/Processors/Corstone-300) platform.
