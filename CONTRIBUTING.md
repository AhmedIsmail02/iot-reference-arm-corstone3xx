# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

# Developerâ€™s Certificate of Origin

Each commit must have at least one `Signed-off-by:` line from the committer to
certify that the contribution is made under the terms of the [Developer
Certificate of Origin](./DCO.txt).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` as part of your git configuration,
you can add a signoff to your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You
have to use your real name (i.e., pseudonyms or anonymous contributions cannot
be made). This is because the DCO is a legally binding document.

# Maintainers and code owners

All contributions are ultimately merged by the maintainers listed below.
Technical ownership of most parts of the codebase falls on the code owners
listed in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file. An acknowledgement from these code
owners is required before the maintainers merge a contribution.

# Code Formatting
IoT Reference Integration for Corstone-300 files are formatted using the "uncrustify" tool. The configuration file used by uncrustify can be found in the [uncrustify.cfg](uncrustify.cfg) file.
